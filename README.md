Software needed to run the assignments
======

Please see below for the  different tools and packages that I am using for the tasks and anslyses.

- Download Anaconda - Anaconda is a package that aims to simplify package management 
- Download Visual Studio Code
- Download Github - https://github.com/AudeAllen/Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis---Tasks-and-Project.git
- To run the tasks simply click on 'Run all' for tasks.ipynb. The project is a mix of code and markdown blocks which explain each part of each task. You can perform this action either in Visual Studio code or in Anconda in Jupyer Notebook.

Assignments
======
### ***currentweather***


Write a python program called currentweather.py that will print out the current temperature on the console (and only the temperature)

Print out the current wind direction (10m) as well

### ***assignment03-cso***

Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO,
and stores it into a file called "cso.json".

======
### ***assignment04-github***
